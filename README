| Pruim -- a Pure RUby IMage library |
+------------------------------------+

Introduction
------------

Pruim is a Pure RUby IMage library, with the indent of supporting 
multiple image formats. Currently only supports loading from and 
saving to PPM files and paletted BMP files. Contributions of 
other formats are welcome. :)

Requirements
------------

BinData (gem install bindata) is required. It makes decoding images much easier.
Watch and autowatchr for testing.
Run watchr test/test.watchr to run the tests.
