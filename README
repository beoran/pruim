= Pruim -- a Pure RUby IMage library

== Introduction

Pruim is a Pure RUby IMage library, with the indent of supporting 
multiple image formats. Currently only supports loading from and 
saving to PPM files and paletted BMP files. Contributions of 
other formats are welcome. :)

== Requirements 

BinData (gem install bindata) is required. It makes decoding images much easier.
Watch and autowatchr for testing.
Run watchr test/test.watchr to run the tests.

 
== License 

You may use Pruim under the Zlib license.
